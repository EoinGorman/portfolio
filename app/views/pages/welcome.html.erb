<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Hello there!<br>
I'm a (mostly) backend developer, looking to use my skills to develop something that solves real problems, with people who enjoy what they do.<br>
I have experience in a wide breadth of languages and technologies. This has given me an ability to pick things up quickly.<br>
I'm a hard worker, good communicator and I would consider myself self-motivated.<br>
Currently upskilling to learn more about Rails and Full Stack development. Enrolled in the Codecademy Pro courses for Ruby on Rails and Full Stack Developer.<br>
Previously based in  Dublin, Ireland but have just moved to Berlin to push myself to learn German.
